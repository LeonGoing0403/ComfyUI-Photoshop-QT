### üîî Open Source Notes

> Due to time constraints, v1 version currently only supports core features. More features will be continuously optimized and gradually added to the open-source version.

- üö´ Removed: Enterprise member features such as member login, server verification, and enterprise API direct image generation
- üí¨ Support: Feedback is welcome on any issues
- ‚≠ê **Special Note**: The current version is obfuscated. Once the project reaches 1000 stars, all unobfuscated source code will be released, welcoming capable developers to create their own versions



## 1. (Required) Install Plugin and Dependencies

First, you need to download the plugin to the `custom_nodes` folder.

1. Open terminal and navigate to the node root directory:
   ```bash
   cd custom_nodes/qtLeon_ps_server
   ```

   <details>
   <summary>View node directory structure</summary>
   
   ![Node directory structure](images/nodes.png)
   </details>

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Place the plugin file in PS root directory, MacOS example:
   ```bash
   /Applications/Adobe Photoshop 2025/Plug-ins
   ```

## 2. (Required) Modify Frontend Project Code

This step is to fix a potential issue in the workflow state management logic of the frontend code. Add null checks for `activeWorkflow` and `changeTracker` states to ensure normal operation. The specific code logic is as follows:

```javascript
activeWorkflow?.changeTracker?.store();
```

1. Locate the static file directory of the ComfyUI frontend project. For example:
   ```bash
   /Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.10/lib/python3.10/site-packages/comfyui_frontend_package/static
   ```

2. Navigate to this directory:
   ```bash
   cd /Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.10/lib/python3.10/site-packages/comfyui_frontend_package/static
   ```

3. Delete all files in this directory and replace them with the **frontend content** provided by the plugin.

   </details>

## 3. (Required) Configure Workflow Display Settings

To ensure proper operation and workflow state monitoring on the Photoshop end, you need to set the ComfyUI workflow panel to display in the sidebar.

1. Start the ComfyUI backend server. Run in the ComfyUI root directory:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. Access the ComfyUI Web interface: `http://127.0.0.1:8188/`

3. Click the **Logo** in the upper left corner, then click the **Settings** button in the dropdown menu.

   </details>

4. In the **Comfy** section of the settings menu, find the **Open Workflows Location** option and set it to **Sidebar**.

   <details>

   ![Workflow settings option](images/settings2.png)
   </details>

5. If this setting is incorrect, the Photoshop end will not be able to correctly get the workflow count and may report the following error:
   ```json
   [ERROR_MESSAGES_COLLECTER] Error source: getWorkflowCountError [SID: EBwBoYDRg7v1_wiKAAAH] - Details: {"data": {"type": "getWorkflowCountError", "message": "Failed to get workflow count TypeError: null is not an object (evaluating '_0x4e817f['textContent']')"}}
   ```

## 4. (Optional) Modify Comfy Backend Code to Monitor Error Messages

If you want to receive popup error messages from ComfyUI on the Photoshop end, you can modify the `server.py` file.

1. Find the `server.py` file in the ComfyUI root directory.

2. Modify the logic in the `/prompt` endpoint code at line 668 by adding the following two code segments at the specified locations.

3. **Code 1:** Add the following code after line 705 to handle **workflow validation failure** errors:
   ```python
   await self.send(
       "prompt_error",
       {"title": valid[1], "errors": valid[3]},
   )
   ```

4. **Code 2:** Add the following code after line 717 to handle **prompt submission failure** errors:
   ```python
   await self.send(
       "prompt_error",
       {"error": error},
   )
   ```
